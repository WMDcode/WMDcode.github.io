### Summary

Biostatistics graduate student and research associate, with a strong background in infectious disease research, molecular diagnostics, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Developing expertise in biostatistical modeling, data analysis, and bioinformatics workflows. Experienced in both wet-lab and computational approaches, with a growing focus on data-driven methods for public health and translational research. Analytical, detail-oriented, and an excellent problem-solver.

### Skills

Extensive experience in library preparation and target enrichment (liquid capture) sequencing using Illumina and Nanopore platforms; various nucleic acid extraction methods; real-time/quantitative PCR (qPCR); BSL-3 laboratory protocols; quality control (QC); and technical training/instruction. Proficient in Python, R, and UNIX/Bash scripting for data analysis and basic pipeline development. Experienced with Microsoft Excel for data handling and reporting.
